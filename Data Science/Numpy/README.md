# NumPy
NumPy (or Numpy) is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reason it is so important for Data Science with
Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building
blocks.

# Installation Instructions
It is highly recommended you install Python using the Anaconda distribution to make sure all underlying
dependencies (such as Linear Algebra libraries) all sync up with the use of a conda install. If you have
Anaconda, install NumPy by going to your terminal or command prompt and typing:

```
conda install numpy
```
atau
```
pip install numpy
```
